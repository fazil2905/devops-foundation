## Phase 3.1 – Basic Application Logging

### Change Introduced
Basic structured logging was introduced into the application using Python’s built-in logging module.

Logging was configured with timestamps, log levels, and clear message formatting.

The application now logs:
- Application startup events
- Incoming HTTP requests
- Client IP and port information

---

### Detection
- Detected by: Manual observation during local runtime
- Detection point: Application console output
- Signal: Timestamped log entries for startup and requests

---

### Time Metrics
- Time to implement: ~10–15 minutes
- Time to verify: ~5 minutes

---

### Root Cause
Previously, the application relied on simple print statements.

This provided no structured visibility into runtime behavior and made it difficult to trace activity or diagnose issues.

---

### Fix Applied
The Python logging module was configured with:
- INFO log level
- Timestamped log format
- Structured log messages

Startup events and request handling were instrumented with logging statements.

---

### Prevention / Optimization
- Prefer structured logs over print statements
- Always include timestamps and log levels
- Treat logging as a core system feature, not an afterthought

---

### Outcome
The system now provides runtime visibility.

Application behavior can be observed in real time, including:
- When the app starts
- When requests are received
- Where requests originate from

This establishes the foundation for deeper observability in future phases (metrics and alerts).

---

## Phase 3.2 – Basic Runtime Metrics (Request Counter)

### Change Introduced
A basic runtime metric was introduced by adding a request counter to the application.

The system now tracks:
- Total number of HTTP requests served
- Per-request activity during runtime

The counter increments on every incoming GET request.

---

### Detection
- Detected by: Manual observation during local runtime
- Detection point: Application console output
- Signal: Increasing request count logged after each browser refresh

---

### Time Metrics
- Time to implement: ~10 minutes
- Time to verify: ~5 minutes

---

### Root Cause
Previously, the application only logged events but did not measure behavior.

There was no way to quantify traffic volume or observe request growth over time.

This limited operational insight into application usage patterns.

---

### Fix Applied
A global request counter variable was introduced.

Inside the request handler:
- The counter increments on every GET request
- The updated total is logged after each request

This provides a simple runtime metric without external tooling.

---

### Prevention / Optimization
- Track measurable behavior, not just events
- Instrument request paths with lightweight metrics
- Use logging temporarily before introducing full metrics systems

---

### Outcome
The system now provides:

- Structured logging (Phase 3.1)
- A measurable runtime metric (Phase 3.2)

Application behavior can now be quantified in real time.

This marks the transition from basic logging to behavioral observability.
